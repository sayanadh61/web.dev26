    <h2>Learning and Skill Development</h2>

    <p>
      One of my main learning goals is to improve my technical skills.
      By the summer, I plan to learn at least one programming language
      to strengthen my understanding of software and web development.
    </p>

    <p>
      Learning programming will help me become more confident when working
      with digital systems and applications. It will also prepare me for
      internships and future job opportunities.

    <h2>Personal and Academic Growth</h2>

    <p>
      In addition to my career and learning goals, I also focus on personal
      development. I want to improve my time management, communication,
      and leadership skills.
    </p>

    <p>
      Staying organized and motivated helps me perform better in my classes.
      I believe that strong personal habits are just as important as
      technical knowledge.
    </p>

    <p>
      Overall, my goals reflect my desire to become a responsible,
      skilled, and confident professional in the technology field.
