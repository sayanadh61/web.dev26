  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    My name is Sayana Adhikari. I am a senior at the University of Kentucky,
    majoring in Information, Communication, and Technology with a minor in Business.
  I grew up in the capital city of Nepal, Kathmandu. I migrated to the United
States at the age of 15. I faced few challenges trying to get used to the study culture here in United States. 
I am where I am supposed to be with the help of amazing teachers who shaped me this way.</p>
