  <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
      My name is Sayana Adhikari. I am a senior at the University of Kentucky,
      majoring in Information, Communication, and Technology with a minor in Business.
      I grew up in Kathmandu, the capital city of Nepal, before moving to the United States.
    </p>

    <p>
      I migrated to the United States at the age of 15. At first, it was challenging
      to adjust to a new culture, language, and education system. However, over time,
      I learned how to adapt and grow in this new environment.
    </p>

    <p>
      Being an international student has helped me become more independent,
      responsible, and confident. I have learned how to manage my time,
      balance school and personal life, and stay focused on my goals.
