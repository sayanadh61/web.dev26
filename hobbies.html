    <h2>Travel Experiences</h2>

    <p>
      Traveling is another hobby that I truly enjoy. Visiting new places allows
      me to learn about different cultures and meet new people. In the past few years, I have travelled to more than 10 states. Now, my next goal is to travel to new countries.
    </p>

    <p>
      Coming from a landlocked country, I love beach. One of my favorite trips was to Myrtle Beach. The peaceful environment and
      beautiful ocean view helped me relax and enjoy nature.

    <h2>Sports Achievements</h2>

    <p>
      Sports play an important role in my life. I used to play badminton and basketball in middle school and first year of high school, but not anymore.
      I wish to pick up on badminton again. Hopefully, I can manage that this year.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have won a silver medal in badminton and a gold medal in basketball.
      These achievements are very precious to me. They motivate me to do better.
